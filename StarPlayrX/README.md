# StarPlayrX

#### This current open source version is considered beta, many changes were made to its middleware and client software and has not been released to the AppStore. Once we are happy with it, there will be a new macOS Catalyst release on StarPlayrX.com and a new iOS AppStore release.

Sirius XM streaming radio for iOS, macOS and iPadOS. StarPlayrX is accessible and this is one of its strong suits.

X stands for ten. Back in 2009 StarPlayr was once on macOS, iOS, Windows and Windows Mobile. It was run by a team of 4 faithful engineers including myself. The startup was called NiceMac. A decade later, I decided to bring StarPlayrX to the app store. This time under my own name and 100% of it is open sourced.

The Mac Catalyst version of StarPlayrX can be compiled by individuals or downloaded on StarPlayrX.com

StarPlayrX is open source along with its two libraries StarPlayrRadioKit and StarPlayrXServe. Anyone who is interested and has some experience with Swift can create their own StarPlayr.

CameoKit and Perfect4 is now deprecated. It has been replaced with StarPlayrRadioKit and StarPlayrXServe (based on Network Framework). All three repos are located on my Github's main page.
 
CameoKit was StarPlayrX's original abstraction layer between SiriusXM and StarPlayrX. StarPlayrRadioKit is its replacement.
